<h1 id="top">How You Can Get Involved!</h1>
<p>
	At Neema Village, we have a LOT of mouths to feed! We need all the help we can get from loving, generous givers like you. There are several ways to help at Neema:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#Pray">Pray for Us</a></li>
		<li><a href="#Sponsor">Sponsor a Little One</a></li>
		<li><a href="#Volunteer">Volunteer</a></li>
		<li><a href="#Spread">Spread the Word</a></li>
		<li><a href="#Donate">Make a One Time Donation</a></li>

	</ul>
</p>
<h2 id="Pray">Pray for Us</h2>
<p>
	Please continue to pray for Neema Village, thanking God for the blessings He has given us, and asking Him to continue to guide us, bless us, and use us to grow the body of Christ. 
</p>
<h3>Prayer of Mercy for Orphans and Children</h3>
<p>
	Loving Father there is nothing that You cannot do and no one that is outside of Your sphere of knowledge – Your word says that You defend the cause of widows and orphans – that you rescue the weak and needy and that You set the lonely in families. 
</p>
<p>	We pray that You would work a mighty work in the lives of all those around the globe that are abandoned, orphaned or simply uncared for and provide for each of 	their needs according to Your riches in mercy and grace. 
</p>
<p>	
	Raise up men, women and ministries that champion the cause of the defenceless and vulnerable. Be their rock of support, their fortress of safety – their shepherd and defender.
</p>
<p>	
	Protect the minds of those that have been exploited and bring them to a knowledge of Jesus and also to a place of refuge, where they may learn of Your Father-heart of love - for all those that are Your children.

<h2 id="Sponsor">Sponsor a Little One</h2>
<p>
	Becoming a Sponsor is a huge help to Neema Village! Sponsorship means that you set up a recurring donation to support a Neema Little One. Recurring donations are the cornerstone to Neema's financial well-being. Knowing that we will have the money to support these precious children means that we can spend our money wisely and plan for new growth. 

	Monthly sponsorships can be set up for any amount! A full sponsorship is $400 per month, but we can combine smaller donations from many people to fully sponsor a little one. 

 	Sponsorships are used to pay salaries for Tanzanian workers, buy food and formula, pay rent, buy petrol, pay medical costs, utilities, etc. Only Tanzanians are paid a salary from sponsorships. All other workers at Neema have their own support or are volunteers. Michael and Dorris are volunteers and do not take a salary from Neema donations.

<h2 id="Spread">Spread the Word</h2>
<p>
	Don't stop here, there are many ways to raise support for Neema Village, and the best part is, they ALL help us to spread the word! Here are a few ideas for how you (and your own little ones!) can become a crucial part of our support team:
	<ul>
		<li>Host a Bake Sale or sell lemonade</li>
		<li>Take up a collection at your church, temple, or work</li>
		<li>Simply post on any social media site with a link to our website!</li>
		<li>Throw down a Challenge! Challenge your family, coworkers, and friends to give up their Starbucks, Netflix account, vending machine addiction, whatever their favorite habit may be for one month, and instead, donate that money to Neema Village. See who can save and give the most!</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h2 id="Donate">Make a One Time Donation</h2>
<p>
	So maybe not everybody can sponsor a baby, and not everyone has the skills to host a bake sale. Of course, you can always submit a One Time Donation. We cannot thank our supporters enough for their encouragement and love for these tiny little ones. Every little bit helps to keep a baby fed, clothed, healthy, and enjoying warm cuddles from our nannies and volunteers!
