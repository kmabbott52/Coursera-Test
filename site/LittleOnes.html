<h1 id="top">Our Little Ones</h1>
<p>
	Each child at Neema has a unique story. We could probably spend weeks telling you about every single child (or you could come on over and get to know them yourself!), but we will do our best to keep it short and sweet here...we know you just want to see their adorable pictures! 
</p>
<p>
	Please consider printing these pictures and stories and keeping them close to you at work, school, bedtime, and at church so that you can pray for each of our Little Ones.

	Don't stop here, there are many ways to raise support for Neema Village, and the best part is, they ALL help us to spread the word! Here are a few ideas for how you (and your own little ones!) can become a crucial part of our support team:
	<ul>
		<li>Host a Bake Sale or sell lemonade</li>
		<li>Take up a collection at your church, temple, or work</li>
		<li>Simply post on any social media site with a link to our website!</li>
		<li>Throw down a Challenge! Challenge your family, coworkers, and friends to give up their Starbucks, Netflix account, vending machine addiction, whatever their favorite habit may be for one month, and instead, donate that money to Neema Village. See who can save and give the most!</li>
	</ul>
