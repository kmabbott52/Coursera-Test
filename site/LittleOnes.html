<h1 id="top">Our Little Ones</h1>
<p>
	Each child at Neema has a unique story. We could probably spend weeks telling you about every single child (or you could come on over and get to know them yourself!), but we will do our best to keep it short and sweet here...we know you just want to see their adorable pictures! 
</p>
<p>
	Please consider printing these pictures and stories and keeping them close to you at work, school, bedtime, and at church so that you can pray for each of our Little Ones.

<h2 id="Orphaned">Orphaned Little Ones</h2>
<p>
	There are 53 million children living without parents in Sub-Sahara Africa (UNICEF*). In Tanzania, with a population of 45 million, there are several million orphans, many of whose parents have died from AIDS. To adopt a child in Tanzania you must live in the country 3 years, be married, and be at least 25 years old, which basically stops out of country adoptions. Most orphanages will not accept babies because they are too expensive to care for and require too many workers.

<h2 id="MotherDied">Little Ones whose Mothers have passed</h2>
<p>
	Due to a shortage of clean blood supply in Africa, mothers die during child birth at a much higher rate, resulting in many babies who only have a father. For families without relatives close by, it can be unfeasible for the fathers to care for their newborn baby all alone while also working to support their families. Neema Village provides temporary relief for these families by caring for the babies until the father or families are able to take the child home.

<h2 id="Abandoned">Abandoned Little Ones</h2>
<p>
	These precious children were left abandoned by their parents. It is a harsh truth that the culture in Tanzania makes it very difficult for young, single mothers. They are often ostracized and shunned if pregnant out of wedlock, and sadly, many of them choose to leave their babies. Additionally, many mothers may believe that leaving their child at a hospital or with a neighbor will be better for the child. In Tanzania, babies are abandoned in hospitals, churches, along the road, in forests, bus stations, and many other places. Whatever their reasons were, we are now giving these little ones as much love as they can handle. We hope that they will find families to adopt them.
