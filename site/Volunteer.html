		Are you looking for a way to make a difference in the world, gain new experiences and training, see new career possibilities, do something different, get away from the normal grind, be adventurous, share your faith, or have you always had a desire to visit Africa?  We can help you achieve any and all of those goals.

		Neema Baby Home is located in the beautiful, East African city of Arusha, Tanzania.  Neema House is a registered NGO in Tanzania and a 501(c)3 nonprofit registered in the US.  We care for abandoned, orphaned and at risk babies.  Currently we have 43 babies from ages, 2 weeks to 4 years.  To see the babyâ€™s pictures and read their stories go to See Neema Babies.  We need all kinds of talents, from film making, painting, teaching, building, physical therapy and nursing to just holding and cuddling babies who need lots love.   

		You can volunteer for up to one month.  A two to four week stay is recommended.  After all, this is Africa and it will require a lot of adjustment on your part.  (To volunteer for longer than one month will require evaluation and approval from the Neema House directors.) Tanzania Immigration Law requires ALL volunteers to first arrive with a tourist visa which cost $100 USD for visitors from America.  Then you must also apply for and be granted a volunteer visa (Called a CTA visa) either at the airport or the next day from the Immigration Office in Arusha.  Neema House will provide a letter of invitation for this and help you with the process.  The CTA visa costs an additional $200 USD.  For the CTA you will need a copy of your resume or CV, and two passport photos.  Be sure to bring these when you come.   Volunteers must be between the ages of 18 to 80.   Younger volunteers must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.    
		    
		What we provide our volunteers:
		<ul>
		<li>Accommodations in an inexpensive ($150 per week or $500 US dollars per month), spacious and beautiful volunteer house separate from the baby home, with all the charm that is Africa and within a one minute walk to Neema. Provided:  Washing Machine, dryer, microwave, stove, fridge, bedding, towels, etc.</li>
		<li>Pick up and return at the Mt. Kilimanjaro airport and the short drive to Neema House.</li>
		<li>Our volunteer house has a cook/cleaning lady Monday thru Friday.  Angel is a great cook and will provide your breakfast and the evening meal.  We have a varied menu which includes eggs, toast, cinnamon rolls, etc. for breakfast, and stew, hamburgers and frys, spaghetti, etc. for dinner.  The morning chai and mid-day meal are provided while on duty at Neema House, but snacks and eating out are on your own.  Most volunteers spend about $150 to $200 for extra food and eating out per month. Remember it is Africa and many of our meals at Neema are African style, rice and beans, ugali and vegetables and luscious fruit.  There are many good restaurants in Arusha.</li>
		<li>Training, supervision and support are also provided. </li>
		<li>Driver and transportation  is provided while on duty at Neema. You will be expected to walk back and forth from the volunteer house to Neema House.  Most volunteers use the inexpensive Dala Dala (minivans) for personal trips to town.  Piki Piki (motorcycle taxis) are strongly advised against.</li>
		<li>Safe, secure grounds with an electric fenced yard and a night time gate guard.</li>
		<li>Help with scheduling game park visits.  The world famous Serengeti and Ngorongoro National game parks are a short drive from Arusha.</li>
